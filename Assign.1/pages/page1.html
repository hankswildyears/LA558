<div>I have no background in writing or editing code on a computer. I hope that this class will provide me the framework for understanding how to use enough html,css, etc. skills in order to put spatial research data online, where anyone can see and edit it. My research intrest is in pedestrain transportation, especially in remote and risk prone areas. I am currently developing a research project studying an ancient pedestrian corridor in far western Nepal. I hope to be able to use this class to build a web-map that will represent local knowlege of routes, places of intrest, and hazards and resources allong a 50 mile footpath in a extreemly remote and mountainous location. I am particularly intrested in being able to represent cognitive spatial understandings with simple shapefiles. I want to learn about the workflow needed to generate informative and editable web-maps. </div>
