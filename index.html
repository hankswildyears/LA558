This is me (Hank) standing on top of the old steel bridge near Sopers Mill while my friend flew a drone over and snaped some pics. I enjoy to go out and climb on stuff and explore new places. Perhaps it is noteworthy to mention that yes, I am indeed three dimensional. However, no, I do not live in a swamp. Mainly, im trying to live some wild years, and drink a few cold beers with friends and smiles and cheers.  <br><br>
